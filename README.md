It is also my first practice while learning ReactJS library, mainly focusing on getting familiar with various types of components and their life cycles, as well as data communication.  
Keep coding and fight on!

## Data source

Use n2yo to get the satellite data.  
Visit https://www.n2yo.com/api/#positions for more details.

## ReactJS based

Runs the app in the development mode using command line 'npm start'.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

## AntDesign3

Use AntDesign3 as the UI library. AntDesign provides a plethora of easy-to-use components that are greatly helpful for building elegant user interfaces.   
Visit https://3x.ant.design/docs/spec/introduce for more details.

## Axios

Use Axios to handle CROS issue.  
Visit https://github.com/axios/axios for more details.

## D3

Use d3-time-format, d3-scale, d3-scale-chromatic to draw the world map.
